Alignment refers to a character's moral and ethical stance and can be used to describe the overall attitude or behavior of a superhero. Some common alignments for superheroes include:
Good: These superheroes are typically kind, selfless, and dedicated to protecting others and upholding justice. Examples of good alignments include Superman, Wonder Woman, and Spider-Man.
Neutral: These superheroes may not always prioritize the greater good, but they are not necessarily evil either. They may act in their own self-interest or make decisions based on their own moral code. Examples of neutral alignments include the Hulk and Deadpool.
Â•	Bad: These superheroes are typically selfish, manipulative, and willing to harm others in pursuit of their own goals. Examples of evil alignments include Lex Luthor and the Joker.''')
